<u><h1> WATER FILLING MACHINE</h1></u>
<p><font size="5px">"No one type of filling machine can handle all liquids in
all industries. For example, a machine that fills bottled water
cannot fill cosmetic cold cream. Nor would a chemical duty
filler be used to fill pharmaceutical grade or dairy products.
Although there are many different types of filling
technologies, there are relatively few that are versatile,
practical and cost effective to own and operateThe choice of
filling machine depends on the range of viscosities,
temperature, chemical compatibility, particulate size, foam
characteristics, and hazardous environment considerations. "</font></p>
