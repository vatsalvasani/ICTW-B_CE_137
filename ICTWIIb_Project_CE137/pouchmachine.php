<h1><u>POUCH MACHINE</u></h1>
<p><font size="5px">"Bag filling and sealing machines can be designed with an inline or rotary layout. For the purpose of
today's article, we are diving deeper into the rotary layout. This design conserves plant floor space and is constructed
with ergonomics top-of-mind, and thus is seeing more popularity than inline models.implified, rotary automatic pouch packing
machines grip a preformed pouch, fill it with product, and seal it, at speeds of up to 200 bags per minute.
This process involves moving the bag in an intermittent rotary fashion to different 'stations' positioned in a circular layout."</font></p>
