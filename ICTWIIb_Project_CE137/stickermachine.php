<h1><u>STICKER LABELING MACHINE</u></h1>
<p><font size="5px">"The principle of the labeling machine is that the item is fed to the labeling machine at a constant speed
on the conveyor. The mechanical fixture separates the items a fixed distance and pushes the item in the direction of the
conveyor. It has a drive wheel, a labeling wheel and a reelSince the label may slip slightly, it has a mark on it to ensure
that each label is placed correctly, which is read by a sensor. During the deceleration phase of the label, the drive wheel
will re-adjust the position to correct any errors on the label.."</font></p>
